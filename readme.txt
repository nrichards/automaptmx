Automaptmx 
by Raven Ironwing (2021)

Automaptmx is a 2D orthogonal TMX (Tiled) map generator. It uses noise to generate large scale landscapes.
Automaptmx combines a basic mask of the desired continent shape (which you can easily make in Gimp or your favorite image editor) with noise
then transforms that noise into a colored image of the landscape which can be adjusted. Once you like the landscape you can export it to tmx format.
The map tiles are block based, but the edges are automatically rounded using replace algorithms and overlay layers. 
This kind of map is optimal for tile based object detection like walls, water, long grass, lava, etc.
The tileset template is in Gimp (xcf) format and can be easily edited to create new biome types.
